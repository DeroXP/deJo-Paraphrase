# information
this is for deJo-GPT this will be the first look on how anti ai detection
will work and how to not get yourself
caught using ai like an idiot will put code in here tommorow pretty almost done with basic stuff but still not done
will add gui and higher character limits
and better performance will probably try to move this project to c# for a better running code platform and easier to make for me sonce it is my first coding language and main one
